# Video SDK Component Integration Guide

This repository contains the Video SDK component that we will integrate into our application. The component consists of several sub-components, styled using Tailwind CSS. You can import the package into any application using the following syntax:

```javascript
import { VideoSDKRTCComponent } from '@local/videosdk-rtc-component';
```

To use and customize this package, please refer to the documentation provided by the Video SDK team. The documentation and APIs can be found [here](https://docs.videosdk.live/api-reference/realtime-communication/intro).

## Usage Example

For example, to integrate the component into the personnel app, you can run the following command:

```
npx nx serve personnel-app
```
